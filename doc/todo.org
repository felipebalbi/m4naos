       be in the lowest byte.

       is done.

       Completed. Managed to get the button in STM32-H405 to trigger an
       interrupt. This has raised a few things to improve in the subsystem,
       though. Tasks will be created.

      We're not going to use IRQ handling threads. At least not for the time
      being. This is because IRQs have controllable priorities and higher
      priority interrupts can already preempt lower priority handlers; this
      is given to us for free by the HW.
