# Introduction

m4naOS is a fully Free (as in **speech**) implementation of a toy
microkernel to run on a STM32F405RG device.

# Motivation

I've always wanted a desktop computer running 100% Free Software. Now that
[Coreboot][1]/[Libreboot][2] have good support for some recent HW running
without any firmware blobs, I feel like the Keyboard is the next natural step.

# Coding Style

We're using the Linux Kernel's style, mainly because I like it and my GNU Emacs
is already configured properly.

Note that we're not aligning argument list to the opening parenthesis, we're
just adding two tabs after the line break.

## Note for contributors

The project will only accept GPL v3+ contributions. Please don't send any code
unless you agree with the terms of GPL v3+.

# License
